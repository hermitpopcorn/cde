# Comparative Data Entry

Since I couldn't figure out how to fit my thesis data into Excel, I decided to put it into a MongoDB collection instead. Then I made an app (this) to write and view the data.

Coding this app taught me that learning Rust is hard. They don't have many example code I can paste straight into my own codebase, so I had to study the docs like some goofy scholar instead of the usual learning-by-doing thing I'm used to.
